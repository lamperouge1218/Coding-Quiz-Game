# Coding-Quiz-Game

## Description

This app was designed to be a short quiz game with questions related to the Coding Bootcamp and what we have learned so far. There are five questions, a timer, a leaderboard with scores, and scores that are stored in the local storage of the page. 

## Usage

This app functions simply, using mostly button click inputs and one form entry for initials at the end of the quiz. For every wrong answer, the timer is diminished by 10 seconds and the screen will show whether the question was answered correctly or incorrectly. Upon finishing the quiz, the user will be shown their score and be able to enter their initials. Their intials and score are then shown on the leaderboard screen and stored in the local storage of the page. 

The app is live at this URL: https://lamperouge1218.github.io/Coding-Quiz-Game/
